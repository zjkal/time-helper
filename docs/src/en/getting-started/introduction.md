# üõéÔ∏è Introduction

## What is TimeHelper?

`TimeHelper` is a simple and user-friendly `PHP Date and Time Helper Library` that enables quick implementation of common date and time operations. It includes functionalities such as getting the number of seconds from a specified time, obtaining a user-friendly time format, checking time ranges, calculating the difference between two times, and providing timestamps for N hours/days/weeks/months/years ago or in the future, among other features.

## What are the main features?

* Light: It does not rely on any extensions and is ready to use out of the box
* Easy: All methods can accept either arbitrary date and time formats or timestamps
* Smart: All operations can be accomplished with just one static method for each

## Why not `Carbon`?

There is no doubt that carbon, as a PHP time and date assistant class library, is very powerful, but I think it is still not simple enough. So TimeHelper appeared. Personal opinion, don‚Äôt comment if you don‚Äôt like it.

## What is the original intention of open source?

Time and date operations are often used. At first, I just used it myself. Later, I made it into a Composer package and shared it with my friends. The response was pretty good. So I decided to improve the documentation, hoping that more programmers would not need to reinvent the wheel.
